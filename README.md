GrannyRoomba or Telepresence Roomba for Grandma
===============================================

The idea of this project is to develop a simple and cheap telepresence robot to improve the Skype experience of a grandmother with her grandchildren.

As of 2013-10-14 (Columbus Day, how emblematic), the system allowed a teleoperation of the GrannyRoomba robot from France to California!

More information about this project in the [project.org](https://github.com/flupes/GrannyRoomba/blob/master/project.org) file.

Currently developped using a [Roomba Create](http://www.irobot.com/hrd_right_rail/create_rr/create_fam/createFam_rr_manuals.html) mobile platform.
