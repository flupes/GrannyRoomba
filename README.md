GrannyRoomba or Telepresence Roomba for Grandma
===============================================

The idea of this project is to develop a simple and cheap telepresence robot to improve the Skype experience of a grandmother with her grandchild.

Key facts:
  - Mobile base uses a Roomba Create
  - Custom tilt mechanism structure using a servo
  - Nexus-7 Android tablet runs the robot software
  - IOIO-OTG board interfaces the tablet with the hardware
  - Messaging is defined using Google Protocol Buffers
  - Communication relies on the ZeroMQ library (more precisely JeroMQ)

As of 2013-10-14 (Columbus Day, how emblematic), the system allowed a teleoperation of the GrannyRoomba robot from France to California!
