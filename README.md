GrannyRoomba or Telepresence Roomba for Grandma
===============================================

The idea of this project is to develop a simple and inexpensive telepresence robot to improve the Skype experience of a grandmother with her grandchild.

On Columbus Day 2013, the system performed successfully a first robotic video conference from France to California!
The system still need improvements, but the concepts are in place.

Quick facts:
  - The mobile base uses a [Roomba Create](http://www.irobot.com/us/learn/Educators/Create.aspx)
  - The custom super-structure uses a tilt mechanism actuated with a servo
  - Nexus-7 Android (gen 1) tablet runs the robot software
  - [IOIO-OTG](https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki) board interfaces the tablet with the hardware
  - Messaging is defined using Google [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
  - Communication relies on the [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) library (more precisely [JeroMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/jeromq))

You can look at some pics from the [Wiki page](https://github.com/flupes/GrannyRoomba/wiki/GrannyRoomba-Wiki-Home).
