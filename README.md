GrannyRoomba or Telepresence Roomba for Grandma
===============================================

The idea of this project is to develop a simple and cheap telepresence robot to improve the Skype experience of a grandmother with her grandchildren.

As of 2013-10-14 (Columbus Day, how emblematic), the system allowed a teleoperation of the GrannyRoomba robot from France to California!

More information about this project in the [project.org](https://github.com/flupes/GrannyRoomba/blob/master/project.org) file.
In short, GrannyRoomba uses a Roomba Create base, a custom tilt system actuated by a servo,
a Nexus-7 for video and control, a IOIO OTG board to link the Android tablet to the hardware,
and quite a bit of Java code.

And you can look at some pics from the [Wiki page](https://github.com/flupes/GrannyRoomba/wiki/GrannyRoomba-Wiki-Home).
